We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-subnet/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Private Subnet
```hcl
  module "subnets" {
    source              = "clouddrove/terraform-aws-subnet/aws"
    version             = "0.15.0"
    name                = "subnets"
    environment         = "test"
    label_order         = ["name", "environment"]
    availability_zones  = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
    vpc_id              = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
    type                = "private"
    nat_gateway_enabled = true
    cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    ipv6_cidr_block     = module.vpc.ipv6_cidr_block
    public_subnet_ids   = ["subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXX", "subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
  }
```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
