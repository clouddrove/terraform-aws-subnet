  Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ### Private Subnet
  ```hcl
    module "subnets" {
      source              = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-subnet.git?ref=tags/0.12.4"
      name                = "subnets"
      application         = "clouddrove"
      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      availability_zones  = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
      vpc_id              = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
      type                = "private"
      nat_gateway_enabled = true
      cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
      public_subnet_ids   = ["subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXX", "subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
    }
  ```

  ### Public-Private Subnet
  ```hcl
    module "subnets" {
      source              = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-subnet.git?ref=tags/0.12.4"
      name                = "subnets"

      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      availability_zones  = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
      vpc_id              = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
      type                = "public-private"
      igw_id              = "ig-xxxxxxxxx"
      nat_gateway_enabled = true
      cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    }
  ```

  ### Public Subnet
  ```hcl
    module "subnets" {
      source              = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-subnet.git?ref=tags/0.12.4"

      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
      vpc_id              = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
      type                = "public"
      igw_id              = "ig-xxxxxxxxx"
